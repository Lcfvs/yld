13/09/2013 - yld version 1.1.9

This version includes some internal improvements changing nothing in its operation.

There's one significant change: in order to avoid recursion problems, the asynchronous execution privileges setImmediate(), then process.nextTick(), then  setTimeout()... depending to the available methods.
